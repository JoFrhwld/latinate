# Latinate Prefixes
I'm trying to get data on latiante prefixes on English verbs.

## The Data
I81379.csv is data from the [English Lexicon Project](http://elexicon.wustl.edu/) with the filter that the word should have between 1 and 3 morphemes. I wanted to exclude inflected and derived forms as much as possible.
